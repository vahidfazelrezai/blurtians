Website for high school Science Bowl Club

The goal of the site is to host information that adds productivity to the Exeter Science Bowl Club, which is achieved in two ways. First, it acts as a reference for essential club information to focus all members on the club's objective. Second, it provides a convenient way to store information related to practices, such as used and unused practice questions and individual statistics.

While some information is outdated, certain functionality like the Play and Links tab are still relevant.

#### Home
This page introduces newcomers to the club and can contain announcements regarding the club's operations.

#### Play
This page acts as an interface to the database of practice questions, which includes questions from practice sources (mainly those linked on the Links page) and student-submitted questions.

#### Statistics
This page allows the specific results of a practice round to be recorded, so that they may be analyzed to identify weaknesses and track progress. Statistics might also be used in the selection of a team to compete at the regional competition.

#### Enter Questions
This page allows users to submit their own questions to the database. The process of writing questions can help in answer questions as well, and this feature is included to encourage question writing.

#### Links
This page compiles links to resources that can improve the strength of the team.
