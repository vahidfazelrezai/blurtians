<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p> This is the unofficial website of Science Bowl Club for 2013-2014. We (used to) meet on Tuesdays at 6:30-8:00 PM in Room 316 (third floor) of Phelps Academy Center.</p>

<p> As a club, we hope to train for and send team(s) to the <a href="http://sciencebowl.uconn.edu">Northeast Regional Science Bowl</a> competition in March 2014. More information about science bowl is available at the <a href="http://science.energy.gov/wdts/nsb/">National Science Bowl website</a>. </p>

<p> You can see our website from last year <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/theblurtgroup/">here</a>. </p>

<p> For more information, contact one of the club co-heads: <a href="mailto:awei@exeter.edu">Alex Wei</a>, <a href="mailto:zsong@exeter.edu">Alex Song</a>, or <a href="mailto:vfazel@exeter.edu">Vahid Fazel-Rezai</a>. </p>
