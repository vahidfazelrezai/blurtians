***** PEA SCIENCE BOWL *****
The goal of the site is to host information that adds productivity to the Exeter Science Bowl Club, which is achieved in two ways. First, it acts as a reference for essential club information to focus all members on the club's objective. Second, it provides a convenient way to store information related to practices, such as used and unused practice questions and individual statistics.

This page introduces newcomers to the club and can contain announcements regarding the club's operations.

* PLAY *
